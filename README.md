## Overview

**DeepVoxel** brings AI-assisted brain MRI analysis to the browser with a clean, intuitive 3D viewer and real-time inference powered by a transformer-based segmentation model. Built with React Next.js, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS, this frontend seamlessly communicates with a lightweight, state-of-the-art backend that leverages knowledge-distilled SwinUNETR for accurate, efficient 3D segmentation.

### üí° What is Swin UNETR?

SwinUNETR is a cutting-edge transformer-based architecture for 3D medical image segmentation. It uses SwinTransformers as the encoder and a UNet-style decoder to produce high-resolution segmentation maps.

### Why Distillation?

Vanilla SwinUNETR models, while powerful, are computationally expensive and heavy on memory (often exceeding 100M parameters). To enable **real-time inference in the browser or lightweight hardware environments**, we applied **knowledge distillation**.

- **Teacher**: Full Swin UNETR (62M+ parameters)
- **Student**: Distilled Swin UNETR (~74% parameter reduction)
- **Final model**: ~15M parameters (‚âà74% smaller)
- **Performance**: Maintains near-identical Dice scores on BraTS 2023 validation set while being **4x faster** during inference, making mid-range GPU and even CPU-only inference possible.

This makes DeepVoxel **lightweight**, **efficient**, and **practical for deployment on resource-constrained systems**.
